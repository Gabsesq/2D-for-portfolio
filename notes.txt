Hello! My name is Gabriella Esquibel. I am a new grad looking to become a fullstack developer. My passion is combining art and technology!


"My favorite languages are Java, Python and secretly LISP", 
      "I picked tech because of the endless learning",
      "Some side softwares I've learned along the way: Procreate, adobe suite, blender, animation",
      "I played college golf, love/hate relationship", 
      "Singing and dancing is one of my favorite pass-times", 
      "I love my dogs!!!"
